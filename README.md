# EmployeeSQL
------------------------------------

### Overview
------------

In this deliverable, we'll conduct a research project about people whom Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, we’ll design the tables and their respective schemas to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then analyze data to learn some findings. That is, we’ll be performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


### Resources
-------------

- 6 CSV files, where the data is derived, are located in the 'data' folder

- Entity Relationship Diagram is provided as a png file named 'ERD'

- 'Schema.sql' contains the Data Engineering portion of this deliverable

- 'DataAnalysisQuery.sql' contains the Data Analysis findings, along with comments that explains the output of each block of code
